        About the dilicious food
    </h1>
    <h3>Poutine, Canada</h3>

        French fries smothered in cheese curds and brown gravy. Sounds kind of disgusting, looks even worse, but engulfs the mouth in a saucy, cheesy, fried-potato mix that’ll have you fighting over the last dollop. Our Canadian friends insist it’s best enjoyed at 3 a.m. after “several” beers.</p>
        <h3>Tacos, Mexico</h3>
        <p>A fresh, handmade tortilla stuffed with small chunks of grilled beef rubbed in oil and sea salt then covered with guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro or anything else you want – perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is the reason no visitor leaves Mexico weighing less than when they arrived.

        <h3>Buttered toast with Marmite, UK</h3>
        <p>OK, anything buttered is probably going to taste great, but there’s something about this tangy, salty, sour, love-it-or-hate-it yeast extract that turns a piece of grilled bread into a reason to go on living. For extra yum (or yuck) factor, add a layer of marmalade.</p>
        <h3>Marzipan, Germany</h3>
        <p>Don’t be fooled by cheap imitations, which use soy paste or almond essence. The real stuff, which uses nothing but ground almonds with sugar, is so good, you’ll eat a whole bar of it, feel sick, and still find yourself toying with the wrapper on bar number two.</p>
        <h3>Ketchup, United States</h3>
        <p>If Malcolm Gladwell says it’s a perfect food, then it’s a perfect food. Let’s face it, anything that can convince 2-year-olds to eat their carrots rather than spitting them onto the floor is worthy of not just a “delicious” title, but a “miracle of persuasion” title, too.</p>
        <h3>French toast, Hong Kong</h3>
        <p>Unlike its more restrained Sunday brunch counterpart, Hong Kong-style French toast is like a deep-fried hug. Two pieces of toast are slathered with peanut butter or kaya jam, soaked in egg batter, fried in butter and served with still more butter and lots of syrup. A Hong Kong best food, best enjoyed before cholesterol checks.</p>
        <h3>Chicken parm, Australia</h3>
        <p>Melted Parmesan and mozzarella cheese, and a peppery, garlicky tomato sauce drizzled over the top of a chicken fillet – Aussie pub-goers claim this ostensibly Italian dish as their own. Since they make it so well, there’s no point in arguing.

        </p>
        <h3>Chili crab, Singapore</h3>
        <p>You can’t visit Singapore without trying its spicy, sloppy, meaty specialty. While there are dozens of ways to prepare crab (with black pepper, salted egg yolk, cheese-baked, et cetera) chili crab remains the local bestseller. Spicy chili-tomato gravy tends to splatter, which is why you need to mop everything up with mini mantou buns.</p>
        <h3>Fish ‘n’ chips, United Kingdom</h3>

            Anything that’s been around since the 1860s can’t be doing much wrong. The staple of the Victorian British working class is a crunchy-outside, soft-inside dish of simple, un-adorned fundamentals.</p>
            <h3> Ankimo, Japan</h3>
            <p>So, who’s up for a chunk of monkfish liver with a little grated daikon on the side? Thought not – still, you’re missing out on one of sushi’s last great secrets, the prized ankimo. The monkfish/anglerfish that unknowingly bestows its liver upon upscale sushi fans is threatened by commercial fishing nets damaging its sea-floor habitat, so it’s possible ankimo won’t be around for much longer. If you do stumble across the creamy, yet oddly light delicacy anytime soon, consider a taste – you won’t regret trying one of the best foods in Japan.</p>
            <h3>Ohmi-gyu beef steak, Japan</h3>
            <p>This premium Japanese Wagyu beef from famed Takara Ranch has been recognized by the Imperial Palace of Japan as one of the greatest beef stocks to be raised in the past 400 years. Called the “Rolls-Royce” of beef, it’s best eaten sashimi style, anointed with a drizzle of kaffir lime and green tea sea salt. Marbled fat gives each mouthful texture as the beef melts away, leaving a subtle but distinctly classic beef flavor.</p>
            <h3>Fajitas, Mexico</h3>
            <p>This assembly kit of a dining experience is a thrill to DIY enthusiasts everywhere. Step 1: Behold the meat sizzling on a fiery griddle. Step 2: Along with the meat, throw side servings of capsicum, onion, guacamole, sour cream and salsa into a warm, flour tortilla. Step 3: Promise all within hearing range that you’ll have “just one more.” Step 4: Repeat.</p>
